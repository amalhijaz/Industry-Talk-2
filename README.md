## OVERVIEW
This industry talk introduced us to the actual expectations in system development and management in the technology industry. The industry talk was supported by Ts. Hj. Abdul Alim Bin Abdul Muttalib who is the Head of Technology & Innovation in Serunai Commerce Sdn Bhd. The talk is about how successful projects in technology are achieved not only through coding. However, through proper planning in addition to utilizing innovative tools in AI.

In the presentation, we understood that a good understanding of computer science fundamentals is a must before moving on to advanced tools. This is because a poor understanding of software development life cycle and other computer science fundamentals often results in software failure. Depending on real-time examples, it was made clear how each stage of software development is important in creating robust and scalable software. This is listed below.

The session also introduced the topic of Agentic Coding, which involves the use of AI tools by developers as assistants to enhance productivity, though full control of the system design and architecture rests with them. We learned that the industry values graduates who can combine AI-assisted development with strong project management skills, such as applying Agile or Waterfall methodologies, knowing how to collaborate in teams, and being able to clearly understand different roles within a project. Only coding is not enough anymore; equally important is managing projects and aligning technical work with business objectives.

From this talk, we came back with a more clear-cut roadmap as to how to prepare ourselves over the next few years. It corroborated the fact that 60% needs to be core knowledge, 40% AI-assisted skills, and assignments and projects need to be treated as 'real' development experience. Overall, this industry talk helped us understand how to become more disciplined, adaptable, and future-ready professionals in the technology field rather than just writing code.

## REFLECTION
This Industry Talk helped me understand that for a successful computer science career, the right mix of technical knowledge and practical skills is required. It showed the importance of strong fundamentals like Algorithms, System Design, and SDLC to project management and teamwork. The session also portrays the responsible usage of AI tools so that productivity gets enhanced but does not replace core understanding; hence, motivating me to do strategic preparation for the demands in the industry in the future.
